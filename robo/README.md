This subfolder contains the ROBO Pro program used to control the Robo Interface and the connected Extension Module. To learn more about this program, please check the video [Part 4: Robo Interface Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXXTODOXXXX). 

At the moment, this subfolder mainly contains the [ROBO Pro program](MSR-RoboInterface.rpp) itself. Be aware that this file will be of little use without a copy of ROBO Pro installed. In this case, you might be interested in the high-resolution screenshots that are provided here as well.
